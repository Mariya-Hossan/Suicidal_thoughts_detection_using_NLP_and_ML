Suicidal Thoughts Detection using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning

This project presents the development and evaluation of a machine learning-based Suicidal Thoughts Detection App. The system utilizes a Decision Tree classifier trained on a dataset of depression-related content. The proposed application aims to provide an initial assessment of user input, identifying potential suicidal thoughts. The model achieves a balanced performance with a macro-average precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.89, and a weighted average of 0.89 for these metrics.
